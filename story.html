	<h3>The Story</h3>
	<p>So the story goes like this.  Mix two old friends with some whiskey poured over an awesome large ice cube and some great conversation and what do you get…?  A watered down drink that at one time had some pretty tasty whiskey in it.  The reason… life distracts you. Lancaster Steel’s solution… don’t let distractions ruin your whiskey.  </p>
<h3>And Thus Us</h3>
<p>We founded Lancaster Steel in Lancaster Pennsylvania in the summer of 2016 because we wanted a Lowball whiskey tumbler that wouldn’t let life’s distractions ruin our hand crafted cocktails.  We are proud to say that we are the first company to create a stainless steel, double wall, old fashioned style lowball tumbler with a sweat resistant design.  Oh, and don’t forget our policy of 100% quality inspection combined with our 100 year warranty. <p>
<h3>Our Reach</h3>
<p> We want to share our creation with you. Follow us on instagram, twitter, and pinterest to see how we and our customers are enjoying our Lancaster Steel Lowball.  Now go on, join the Lancaster Steel movement, fill your Lowball with some liquid sunshine on the rocks and let life distract you without fear.  You have earned it.  The next one is on us.  Cheers!<p>
